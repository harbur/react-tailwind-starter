# Directories Structure

The following is a list of common directories, they are ordered by dependency tree (each directory can only use upper ones):

typescript:
* `src/models`: The models.
* `src/actions`: The actions to external APIs.
* `src/stores`: The stores that handle declarative state of the APIs actions.

UI:
* `src/components`: Reusable basic components of the UI that are isolated (e.g. buttons)
* `src/layouts`: Reusable layouts of the UI.
* `src/cards`: Reusable components of the UI that can use stores.
* `src/pages`: Pages of the application.
