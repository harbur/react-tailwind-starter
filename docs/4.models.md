# Models

We defined models under `src/models` directory.

We follow domain-driven design, having the domain (aka. `models`) to the center without dependencies to external libraries.

## Movies

Models are defined under the `src/models` directory.

Below is an example of `movies.ts`:

```ts
export default interface Movie {
    ID: number | undefined,
    name: string,
}
```
