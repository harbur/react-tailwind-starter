# Initial Setup

## Bootstrapping

To bootstrap a project from scratch using `create-react-app` & `typescript` do the following:

```sh
npx create-react-app <appName> --template typescript
```

> There is currently an issue with typescript version: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/10110
>
> [fix](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/10110#issuecomment-731379325)
>
> > Personally, I was able to fix this issue (this is on a fresh project) by:
> > - changing the typescript version in package.json to "~4.0.5"
> > - changing the value "jsx" in compilerOptions inside tsconfig.json to "react" instead of "react-jsx"
> > - run npm install so that the older typescript version is installed
> > - I don't think this is needed but perhaps make sure vscode has the intellisense of ts set to the same or similar version to the one you've installed Mine is set to use the local one I just installed - 4.0.5
> > - I was then able to start the project normally with npm start

## Build Tool

We use `npm` as our build tool.

## Proxy

In order for the frontend to be able to communicate with the backend without CORS issues we need to setup a proxy, this can be done on the `package.json`. If our backend runs on port `8080` then we can instruct the frontend to proxy there with the following line:

```json
 {
    "proxy": "http://localhost:8080",
 }
```

## Semantic UI

We use [Semantic UI] JS framework and we integrate it with react using [Semantic UI React].

[Semantic UI]: https://semantic-ui.com/
[Semantic UI React]: https://react.semantic-ui.com/

To setup:

```sh
npm add semantic-ui-react --save --force # There is an issue with React 17 compatibility https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/pull/4031
npm add semantic-ui-css --save
```
